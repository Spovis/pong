### Pong Assignment

## Quick Start 

 - Download `Pong_Kenny_Kline` and just double click it

 - Use `w` and `s` to move the left paddle and the arrow keys to move the right one
 - Press `h` for a help menu

## Compiling the code

Updating the code will require a new build. If you do not have unity installed, see the instuctions below.

 - Open Unity (or download it now)
   - Note: This code was written using Unity Versioin 2022.3.43f1
   - You will need to be able to open a new project to build the game
 - Open a new 2d project
 - Copy the `Assets` directory from this project into your new project
 - In the top left corner select file -> Build & Run
 - Unity will automatically compile everything into the necessary files and create one convenient Pong application file that you can click on whenever you would like to play.
   - Note Unity creates several other files and folders that must be in the same directory of the Pong application for the game to run.
